[Hypergraph Neural Networks Thesis Project Report](resources/fom__down_.pdf)

My honours project on hypergraph neural networks (HGNN), a less-explored area of deep learning that ingests hypergraph data structures.
This project involves implementing hypergraph message passing neural networks(HMPNN), then experimenting, testing and analysing its performance.
I explored multiple techniques to increase the accuracy of the HMPNN, from vicreg regularisation to architectural search.
I also provided significant mathematical analysis on the results of the experimentations, where i got a grade of A+ for my contributions.
